# Wish.com Summer Sales Business Intelligence Project

This repository contains all the files and documentation for the business intelligence (BI) analysis of the Wish.com Summer Sales dataset. The project's goal is to provide actionable insights on sales performance, product popularity, and customer purchasing behavior.

## Repository Contents

- `Wish.com raw dataset` (excel): The initial dataset provided by Wish.com containing detailed listings and performance metrics of summer products sold on the platform.
- `Wish.com raw dataset variables sheet` (pdf): A PDF document outlining the definitions and descriptions of the variables included in the raw dataset.
- `Data (post ETL)` (excel): The processed dataset after performing Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) operations. This file includes cleaned, translated, and segmented data ready for analysis.
- `WISH BI` (powerbi): The Power BI file with the complete setup for the BI analysis, including data models, visualizations, and reports.
- `PowerBI Figures` (pdf): A PDF document containing all the figures and charts generated from the Power BI analysis.
- `WISH Sales BI Report`: The final report document that consolidates all findings, insights, and recommendations from the BI analysis.

## Project Structure

- **Data Preparation**: The raw data was cleaned and prepared using Excel, where several data preperation, cleaning, and transformation processes were carried out, including: non-English text was translated, characters were corrected, discounts were calculated, seperated tables were created by segments, etc. The 'Data (post ETL)' file reflects these changes.
- **Analysis and Visualization**: Power BI was used to conduct the analysis and create visualizations, as documented in the 'WISH BI' file.
- **Reporting**: Findings and insights were compiled into the 'WISH Sales BI Report', which includes a detailed narrative and recommendations for the Wish.com management team.
